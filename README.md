# Secure Messaging API - Backend Coding Challenge

## Overview
This project is a secure messaging API built with Node.js using Express. The API encrypts messages using AES-256 in CBC mode before storing them, and only the intended user can decrypt and access their messages. The project also includes debugging functionality to fix a broken decryption function.

The project was created as part of a backend coding challenge, aiming to demonstrate secure data handling, clean code structure, and well-thought-out design decisions.
